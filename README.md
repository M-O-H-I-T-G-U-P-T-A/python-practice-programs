Q1. Create a function in Python that accepts two parameters. The first will be a list of numbers. The second parameter will be a string that can be one of the following values: asc, desc, and none.

If the second parameter is "asc," then the function should return a list with the numbers in ascending order. If it's "desc," then the list should be in descending order, and if it's "none," it should return the original list unaltered.
Q2.Write a function in Python that accepts a credit card number. It should return a string where all the characters are hidden with an asterisk except the last four. For example, if the function gets sent "4444444444444444", then it should return "4444".



Q3. Write a Python function that accepts three parameters. The first parameter is an integer. The second is one of the following mathematical operators: +, -, /, or . The third parameter will also be an integer.
The function should perform a calculation and return the results. For example, if the function is passed 6 and 4, it should return 24.


Q4.Create a Python function that accepts a string. The function should return a string, with each character in the original string doubled. If you send the function "now" as a parameter, it should return "nnooww," and if you send "123a!", it should return "112233aa!!".


Q5. Write a program in Python for, In a array 1-100 multiple numbers are duplicates.


Q7. Python Program to find highest frequency element in array.


Q8. Python program to calculate sum of integers in string.


Q9. Python Program to sort characters of a string in ascending order.

Q10.  Python program to swap two numbers using xor.

Q11. Write a Python Program to Check if a String is a Palindrome or Not


Q12. Write a program in Python for, In an array 1-100 multiple numbers are duplicates. Now in O(n) time only.


Q13. Find one number in array, which has odd count (O(n) time and O(1) space).


Q14. Finding GCD of 2 numbers ( O(log(min(a,b))) time and space) 


Q15. Python program to count alphabets, digits and special characters in a string.


Q16. Python program to print first n Prime Numbers for multiple test cases, in the least possible time.


Q17. Consider the number 45656. It can be seen that each pair of consecutive digits of 45656 has a difference of one.
A number for which every pair of consecutive digits has a difference of one is called a step number.
A pandigital number contains every decimal digit from 0 to 9 at least once.
How many pandigital step numbers less than 1040 are there?


Q18. AN man was given directions to go from point A to point B. The directions were: “SOUTH”, “NORTH”, “WEST”, “EAST”. Clearly “NORTH” and “SOUTH” are opposite, “WEST” and “EAST” too. Going to one direction and coming back in the opposite direction is a waste of time and energy. So, we need to help the man by writing a program that will eliminate the useless steps and will contain only the necessary directions. 
For example: The directions [“NORTH”, “SOUTH”, “SOUTH”, “EAST”, “WEST”, “NORTH”, “WEST”] should be reduced to [“WEST”]. 


Q19. A low-level implementation of the classic game “Wordle”. We need to write a program that generates a four-digit random code and the user needs to guess the code in 10 tries or less. If any digit out of the guessed four-digit code is wrong, the computer should print out “B”. If the digit is correct but at the wrong place, the computer should print “Y”. If both the digit and position is correct, the computer should print “R”.


Q20. The number, 197, is called a circular prime because all rotations of the digits: 197, 971, and 719, are themselves prime.
There are thirteen such primes below 100: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 31, 37, 71, 73, 79, and 97.
How many circular primes are there below one million?
